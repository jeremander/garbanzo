# Garbanzo

`garbanzo` is a web dashboard providing various stats and charts for a [beancount](https://github.com/beancount/beancount) ledger.

It is intended to supplement the features provided in the popular [Fava](https://github.com/beancount/fava/) library.

`garbanzo` is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io).

**NOTE**: this is very much a work-in-progress and could just as well be "plugged in" to some other dashboard framework. For example, Fava supports [custom dashboards](https://github.com/andreasgerstmayr/fava-dashboards), but at present they are limited to HTML/JavaScript.

**NOTE**: at present, this has only been tested with `beancount` v2.
